#### Hello 👋🏽

- 🏢 I am a Software Developer. I help companies and non-profits to build mobile apps and websites.
- 🧰 I build with: `TypeScript`, `React`, `React Native`, `Prisma` and `Tailwind`, and `Wordpress`
- 🚢 I have a bias for shipping products and I will use the right tool for each job.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my iOS apps :  [GazetteRSS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/gazette-rss/id6450015408), [BibleDuo](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/bibleduo-étudiez-la-bible/id6502559093), [TrailWayGPX](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/trailway-gpx/id6670142969) and [SursumCorda](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/sursum-corda/id1615083215)
- 🌱 I am currently learning Laravel
- 🧠 I'm looking to collaborate with designers and marketers to build and grow great apps that reach millions.
- ⚡ When I am not coding, I enjoy photography, reading, playing soccer and tennis, lifting weights and managing my home automation and servers.

** Because of this new trend of AI and public data being used to train AI models like Github Copilot, I now host all my code privately on my private servers using Gitea. **
