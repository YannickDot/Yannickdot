#### Hello 👋🏽

- 🏢 I am a Software Developer. I help companies and non-profits to build mobile apps and websites.
- 🧰 I build with: `TypeScript`, `React`, `React Native`, `Expo`, `Tailwind`, `Prisma` and `Wordpress`.
- 🚢 I have a bias towards shipping. I like to iterate a lot on every product I build because building apps is like sowing seeds. They grow throughout the seasons!
- 🔭 I am working on [my iOS apps](https://apps.apple.com/fr/developer/galanga-studios/id1476853585) :  [GazetteRSS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/gazette-rss/id6450015408), [BibleDuo](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/bibleduo-étudiez-la-bible/id6502559093), [TrailWayGPX](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/trailway-gpx/id6670142969) and [SursumCorda](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/sursum-corda/id1615083215)
- 📈 In my spare time, I cook up TradingView indicators for fun.
- 🌱 I am currently learning `Laravel`
- 🧠 I'm looking to collaborate with designers and marketers to build and grow great apps. Feel free to say hi!
- ⚡ When I am not coding, I take pictures, I read, I play tennis, lift weights and manage my home automations and servers.

**Because of this trend of using public (and private?) data to train AI models like Github Copilot, I now self-host all my code on my private server using Gitea. 😉**

**I'll only keep the Open Source stuff here on Github.**
